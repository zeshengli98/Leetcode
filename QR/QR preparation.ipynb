    "You have 20 stacks of 30 coins each. The coins come into 2 types - U.S. coins, which weigh 25 grams each, and Canadian coins, which weigh 30 gram each.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Each Stack contains coins of only one type, and there is precisely one stack of Canadian coins. You have a digital scale which can tell you the exact weight of any combination of coins.\n",

    "What is the minimum number of measurements you need to perform to guarantee that you find the stack of Canadian coins?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solution\n",
    "**One time.** I can place total 190 coins on the digital scale, 1 from the first stack, 2 from the second stack ... 20 from the last stack. If we assume all the coins are U.S. coins, we will get 25\\*190 = 4750grams on the scale, but this can't happen because there is exactly one stack of coins belongs to Canadian. Therefore, we can read the total number of grams and see the difference between the actual number and the ideal number (4750), so we can compute the difference and divide by 5 to get the number of Canadian coins in the stack."

    "\n",
    "***Solution*** \n",
    "Using the same method above to recursion problems is easy. Let $E[i]$ be the expected number of steps the process takes to reach the absorbing state 5 from i, and clearly $E[5]=0, E[4]=1$, then we can compute $E[3] = 1+ \\frac12E[4]+\\frac12E[5] = \\frac32$.\n",

    "There once was a drunk man who wandered far too close to a cliff. From where he stands, one step forward would send the drunk man over the edge.

What is his chance of escaping the cliff?\n",
    "\n",
    "***Solution*** 1/2\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a more general situation. Define the probability of falling off the cliff from 1 is $P_1$, This is of interest since it is always the prerequisite step for falling off the cliff.\n",

    "A important question: what is $P_2$?\n",
    "P2 is the probability of falling off the cliff on a path originating from 2 steps away. In order to fall off the cliff you have to move from 2 → 1 and from 1 → 0. The step in the walk is independent, so the move from 2 → 1 exactly behaves the same way as 1 → 0, so we can use 2-step $P_1$ represent the $P_2$. We can restructure the equation:\n",

Those P1 with p < 1/2, we can see the drunkard 100% fall into the cliff, if p >= 1/2, we can calculate the probability of falling off by $\\frac{1-p}{p}$. Back to our origin problem, the probability of falling is 1/2, so the escaping prob is also 50%.\n",

    "***Solution*** $P = 1-(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}-\\frac12)^N$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P_i$ represents the bankrupt probablity at \\\\$i, so clearly $P_0 = 1$, and $P_1$ is the state of interest because every bankrupt happen must go through this state, so it's the prerequisite of the bankrupt. \n",

    "The similar reasoning as above technique, $P_3$ is the probability of bankrupt when player has \\\\$3, so we can consider the $P_3$ as 3-step $P_1$ because those states are independent. So we can get the new equation:\n",

    "$P_1 = 1, \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}-\\frac12, -\\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{2}-\\frac12$, we need to have the condition that $0<P_1<1$, so we can drop the negative prob, and 1.\n",
