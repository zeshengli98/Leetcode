    "You have 20 stacks of 30 coins each. The coins come into 2 types - U.S. coins, which weigh 25 grams each, and Canadian coins, which weigh 30 gram each.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Each Stack contains coins of only one type, and there is precisely one stack of Canadian coins. You have a digital scale which can tell you the exact weight of any combination of coins.\n",
    "        \n",
    "What is the minimum number of measurements you need to perform to guarantee that you find the stack of Canadian coins?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solution\n",
    "**One time.** I can place total 190 coins on the digital scale, 1 from the first stack, 2 from the second stack ... 20 from the last stack. If we assume all the coins are U.S. coins, we will get 25\\*190 = 4750grams on the scale, but this can't happen because there is exactly one stack of coins belongs to Canadian. Therefore, we can read the total number of grams and see the difference between the actual number and the ideal number (4750), so we can compute the difference and divide by 5 to get the number of Canadian coins in the stack."

    "1) Assume we don't consider the order we put coins into pocket. So each coin has 5 pockets to go, and second has 5 pockets to go as well... In total we have $5^8$ combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Therefore, if we add the order restriction here, we should consider permutations and combinations separately and apply the multiplication rule. Let's consider how many combinations of locations we have in five days. Suppose we have four blocks dividing the locations into five days, then we can calculate the number of combinations of blockers and locations: we have $C^4_{12}$ situations. We can then permute the order of all locations, so the final case will be $8! * C^4_{12}$ \n",
