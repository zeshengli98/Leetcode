    "This is a document for preparing all kinds of probability, statistics, stochastic process, brain teasers for 2023 Quantitative Researcher position. I plan to aggregate and categorize the technical interview questions for myself to review and polish quantitative skills and mindset."

    "You have 20 stacks of 30 coins each. The coins come into 2 types - U.S. coins, which weigh 25 grams each, and Canadian coins, which weigh 30 gram each.\n",
    "        \n",
    "Each Stack contains coins of only one type, and there is precisely one stack of Canadian coins. You have a digital scale which can tell you the exact weight of any combination of coins.\n",
    "        \n",
    "What is the minimum number of measurements you need to perform to guarantee that you find the stack of Canadian coins?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solution\n",
    "**One time.** I can place total 190 coins on the digital scale, 1 from the first stack, 2 from the second stack ... 20 from the last stack. If we assume all the coins are U.S. coins, we will get 25\\*190 = 4750grams on the scale, but this can't happen because there is exactly one stack of coins belongs to Canadian. Therefore, we can read the total number of grams and see the difference between the actual number and the ideal number (4750), so we can compute the difference and divide by 5 to get the number of Canadian coins in the stack."
